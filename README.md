## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/combinePDF.gif)

This project is a simplistic lightweight PDF converter coded in Java. This was made in order to speed up ImageToPDF conversions in a quick, offline and graphical method. This was mainly made in order to speed up the process in which I submit assessment tasks for university.

## Built With

This application was made in Java utilizing base libraries, in addition, this application was also made in tandem with:

* [IText 5.5.0](https://github.com/itext/itextsharp/releases/tag/iTextSharp_5_5_0)

## Getting Started

To use this project just simply download the .jar file and run when needed. To upload images, just drag and drop the selected files and once ready to convert, select the "CONVERT" button.

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/ShaanCoding/CombinePDF/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
